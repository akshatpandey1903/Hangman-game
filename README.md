# HANGMAN-GAME

## Project Motivation
I'm creating this project because I wanted to build something I actually enjoy, even if it's as simple as a hangman game. Previously, I found myself going down the rabbit hole of trying to find projects that would make my resume look better or land me an internship. This often resulted in simply copying from tutorials instead of truly learning and creating on my own.

## Current Features
- Basic hangman gameplay
- Word selection from a file
- Console-based user interface

## Progress
The game is currently a simple game which runs on the the terminal

## Future Plans
I aim to add several features to enhance the game:
- Options for different word genres
- Implementing a point system
- Creating an Interface
- Adding difficulty levels

## Learning Goals
- Improve file handling in C++
- Implement more robust error checking
- Enhance game logic and user experience

## Note 
I'm still in my learning process, and I want to ensure I'm happy with what I create. This project represents my journey in practical C++ programming and game development.
